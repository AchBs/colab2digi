## 🚀 What is Digimon Colab Mode?

**Digimon Colab Mode** is a Chrome extension that replaces Google Colab’s default animals (Gorki, Cat, Crab) with **Digimon characters that evolve as you work**.

The more you code, the more your Digimon grows.

> 🧠 Productivity + 🎮 Gamification + 🐉 Digimon

## ✨ Why You’ll Love It

✅ Turns boring coding sessions into a game  
✅ Encourages consistency & focus  
✅ Evolution & digivolution mechanics  
✅ Collect different Digimons  
✅ Lightweight & privacy-friendly  
✅ Runs entirely locally  

If you like **Digimon**, **gamification**, or **fun developer tools**, this is for you.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The extension tracks **activity inside Google Colab**
- Progress is converted into **Digimon evolution stages**
- Evolutions happen in the **extension popup**
- A **small notification** appears when a digivolution is available

> More work → evolution → dopamine → more work 🔁
